### Power BI Sales Dashboard Project Description

In this Power BI project, I created an interactive and visually insightful **Sales Dashboard** to help stakeholders quickly analyze and interpret key sales data. The dashboard aggregates and visualizes sales performance across various segments, orders, and geographical regions, providing a comprehensive view of sales trends and patterns. Key features of the dashboard include:

- **Sum of Sales by Segment**: Displays the total sales across different sales segments, allowing users to compare performance and identify top-performing categories.
- **Sum of Sales by Order Date**: A time-based visualization showing how sales evolve over time, helping to spot seasonal trends or sales peaks.
- **Sum of Sales by Sub-Categories**: Breaks down sales by sub-categories within each segment, offering more granular insights into product performance.
- **State Map Visualization**: Geographically represents sales distribution across various states, providing a clear view of regional performance.
- **Sum of Sales by Region**: A summary of sales data grouped by region, enabling regional comparisons and performance assessments.

The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and interactive, offering dynamic filtering options and drill-through capabilities to allow users to explore the data from different perspectives. This project supports data-driven decision-making, enabling better sales strategies and regional resource allocation.
